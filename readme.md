# Higher Education World University Rankin
The dataset is the Higher Education World University Ranking, which is widely regarded as one of the most influential and widely observed university measures.  
Founded in the United Kingdom in 2010. I got the data from the Kaggle competition(https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/world-university-rankings). I chose this dataset because I’m interested in the rankings among universities across the world.   
I used to study in the top university in my country, but it is only ranked around 50~100th in the World University rankings. Now I’m studying at the University of San Francisco, which is a school that I 100% respect, but the world ranking for USF is probably some hundred away from the so-called “top schools”. I want to dig deeper in the dataset and see if there’s anything
interesting.   

Is there a pattern for higher-ranked schools in certain countries? Where are those high-ranked schools located? I want to answer these questions and discover more.  
The dataset contains some basic information of the ranked institutions: world rank, national rank, country, quality of education, quality_of_faculty,publications, citations and year.  
  
#### Let’s do some exploratory data analysis with visualizations:
  
Firstly, to understand how many institutions are there in the dataset, we plot the distinct number of universities in the dataset. We can see clearly that the number of universities in the USA is more than twice the number of China and all the rest of the world.
